# 📧 Spam Detection System



# Model 1️⃣ Predicting Accuracy

🔍 Description
This project is a Spam Detection System built using Python and Scikit-learn. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether an incoming SMS message is spam or not based on word patterns. The system uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical features and is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages.

# 🚀 Features

🧠 Machine Learning : Uses Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method.

📊 Feature Extraction : Text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

💬 Text Classification: Classifies messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

📈 Model Evaluation : Reports accuracy, precision.

📂 Dataset: The SMS Spam Collection dataset is used in this project. Downloaded from Kaggle(As per the given dataset).

   🛴 SMS messages 
  
   🛴 Spam: Unwanted or harmful messages.
   
   🛴 Ham: non-spam messages.
